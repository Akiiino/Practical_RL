* Lecture and seminar videos (russian) - [lecture](https://yadi.sk/i/5yf_4oGI3EDJhJ), [seminar](https://yadi.sk/i/dPsWYMK13EDJj7) _only covering crossentropy method_
* [__main__] Lecture by J Schulman with crossentropy method explained (english) - [url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUrX-rP_ss4&list=PLCTc_C7itk-GaAMxmlChrkPnGKtjz8hv1)

## Homework description
* Just follow the [notebook](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/fall17/week1/crossentropy_method.ipynb)
* During the `CartPole-v0` section (and similar envs), a window will pop up, displaying some game state. The window won't respond to direct input and is instead changes each time you call env.render(). Don't force-close this process, just ignore it until you complete the notebook.
* __important__ the current newest version of gym force-stops environment in 200 steps even if you don't use env.monitor.
  * This may ruin CEM on MountainCar. To avoid this, use gym.make("MountainCar-v0").env when creating env.


## Project opportunity

* The first project opportunity is to implement the Evolutionary Strategies.
